##Hyperdex Hyperclient D Deimos Bindings

From [hyperdex.org](http://hyperdex.org/):
"HyperDex is the next generation key-value store with a wide array of features. HyperDex may be a good fit for you if your application needs to:

- Perform atomic transactions over multiple objects, in a fast, scalable NoSQL data store.
- Store rich datatypes such as strings, integers, floats, lists, maps, and sets.
- Search and retrieve objects efficiently by secondary attributes.
- Ensure that your data is up to date at all times with strong consistency guarantees.
- Protect your data against a configurable number of simultaneous failures.

HyperDex's key features -- namely its rich API, strong consistency, and fault tolerance -- provide strong guarantees to applications that are not matched by other NoSQL systems.

Of course, if the data is rarely modified, or it has no consistency or fault-tolerance requirements, HyperDex may not be for called for, though it still outperforms other NoSQL stores that provide weaker guarantees."

###Version: 1.6.0

Status: All of the standard api is ported.  In the future I may port over the Warp api as needed.
